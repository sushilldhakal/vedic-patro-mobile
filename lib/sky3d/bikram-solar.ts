/**
 * A बिक्रम सम्वत् reading for instants the offline table cannot reach.
 *
 * `lib/bs-calendar` carries a compiled table of month starts for बि.सं.
 * 1700–2200 and is authoritative inside it. Past the end it has nothing to say,
 * and {@link adToBS} pins to the last month start — which is why the 3D sky's
 * clock froze at २२०० चैत the moment the simulation ran past AD 2144 while the
 * day number kept climbing.
 *
 * Out there the Sun itself is the calendar, which is what it always was. The
 * बिक्रम months *are* the solar rashi: बैशाख begins at मेष संक्रान्ति, the
 * instant the Sun's sidereal longitude crosses 0°, and each month begins at the
 * next 30°. So the month is read straight off the Sun the scene is already
 * computing, the day is how far into that rashi it has travelled at its own
 * rate, and the year is counted in whole solar years from an anchor the table
 * *does* know.
 *
 * This is a **display** reading, marked as approximate wherever it is shown:
 * the true panchanga resolves a sankranti to the second and applies the day's
 * own rules for which civil day it belongs to. It is honest about the year and
 * the month; the day may sit one either side of the almanac's.
 *
 * Note that this drifts against the Gregorian calendar on purpose. बिक्रम is a
 * sidereal calendar, so मेष संक्रान्ति stays with the stars while the seasons
 * precess away from it — in ten thousand years बैशाख १ is nowhere near April,
 * and that is not an error.
