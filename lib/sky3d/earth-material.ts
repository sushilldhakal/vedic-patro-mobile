/**
 * The Earth globe's surface, shared by the Learn playground and the Aakash
 * Gochar sky.
 *
 * Its own shader rather than one of three's lit materials, for two reasons.
 *
 * **Opacity.** Every fragment writes alpha 1 with blending off, and it always
 * writes depth. Nothing can make the planet see-through, and the belts, orbit
 * lines and grid behind it are hidden by it rather than painted over its face.
 *
 * **The terminator.** Day and night come from `N·L` against the Sun's world
 * position, so the lit cap is centred on the subsolar point: it rides north
 * through उत्तरायण and south through दक्षिणायन exactly as the Sun's declination
 * does, and the boundary is a curve on the sphere rather than a straight cut.
 *
 * Both callers pass the *cartoon* map. It is flat colour with hard coastlines,
 * which survives being dimmed to a third far better than a photograph does —
 * and being dimmed rather than blacked out is the point, because the far side
 * of the planet is what a reader is trying to follow while it turns.
 *
 * Byte-identical port of the web's `src/lib/sky3d/earth-material.ts` — plain
 * GLSL and `three` API, nothing DOM-specific to change for `expo-gl`.

/**
 * How much of the map survives on the night side.
 *
 * Not zero. A black cap hides which country is about to come round, which is
 * the one thing the turning globe is there to show. Dark enough that the lit
 * side is unmistakably the lit side.
