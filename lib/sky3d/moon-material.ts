/**
 * The Moon's face in the horizon and globe views — the phase, drawn honestly.
 *
 * ## Why not just light it, the way अन्तरिक्ष does
 *
 * In the space view the grahas ride shells at something like their true
 * arrangement, so the Sun's own point light falling on the Moon lands the
 * terminator where it belongs and `meshStandardMaterial` needs no help.
 *
 * The other two views place every body at one fixed radius — on the horizon
 * dome, or on the band around the globe — because what they are drawing is a
 * *direction*, not a distance. That keeps every angle in the sky exactly right
 * and throws all the distances away, which is the correct trade for a sky map
 * and fatal for lighting: the Sun ends up the same distance from the observer
 * as the Moon, so the vector from Moon to Sun is nothing like the real one.
 *
 * Lighting the Moon from the Sun's *drawn* position gives a phase angle of
 * `acos(sin(ε/2))` for an elongation ε — half-lit at औंसी and 85% lit at the
 * quarters. Never a crescent, never a new Moon. Confidently wrong is worse than
 * flat, which is why those views drew the Moon evenly lit instead.
 *
 * ## What this does
 *
 * The Sun is 400 times further off than the Moon, so its rays arrive parallel:
 * the lit hemisphere faces the *geocentric direction* of the Sun, and nothing
 * about the real distances matters. That direction survives the projection
 * intact — it is exactly what these views do keep — so `N·L` against it is the
 * true phase, seen from wherever the camera happens to be.
 *
 * A direction uniform rather than a position, then, and the caller feeds it the
 * normalised position of the drawn Sun. See {@link makeEarthMaterial}, which
 * solves the same problem the other way round: the globe is at the origin at
 * its true scale, so there a position is what is wanted.
 *
 * Byte-identical port of the web's `src/lib/sky3d/moon-material.ts` — plain
 * GLSL and `three` API, nothing DOM-specific to change for `expo-gl`.

/**
 * How much of the map survives on the unlit side.

 * a full Earth hanging over it, which is why the whole disc is visible inside a
 * young crescent — "the old Moon in the new Moon's arms". Faint enough that the
 * lit limb is never in doubt.
