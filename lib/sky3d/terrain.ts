/**
 * The ground the क्षितिज view stands on — a 360° valley of hills, generated
 * rather than drawn.
 *
 * The horizon view puts the reader at the centre of a dome with the camera at
 * the origin, so "the ground" is whatever fills every direction below the
 * skyline at once. A flat disc does that, but it says only *down*: no skyline,
 * so the compass points sit on a drawn circle and nothing tells you that the
 * Sun is about to clear a ridge rather than the mathematical horizon.
 *
 * This builds a radial mesh instead — a ring of overlapping hills all the way
 * round, the same idea as standing in a valley and turning on the spot. Relief
 * is real 3D (hills rise and fall with distance, and can occlude each other)
 * because the mesh is drawn opaque with depth, so a later triangle is allowed
 * to hide an earlier one.
 *
 * ## Why it is seeded
 *
 * The app prerenders its pages, and this geometry has to be identical between
 * the server pass and hydration — an unseeded `Math.random()` skyline would
 * also reshuffle itself on every remount, which fullscreen does. Seeding it
 * from the observer's own coordinates goes one better: काठमाडौँ gets one ring of
 * hills and keeps it, and moving the observer moves you to a different place
 * rather than to the same place with new scenery.
