   * `(tabs)/_layout.tsx`'s `screenLayout` wraps the panchanga tab's whole
   * nested Stack, not each leaf screen — so `PanchangaTabsShell` switching
   * between a plain `View` (shellRoute false) and a `ScrollView` (shellRoute
   * true) is a React *element type* change at the position holding that
   * entire Stack. React remounts across a type change; the Stack — including
   * whatever screen a `router.push` had just navigated it to — went with it,
   * landing back on `/panchanga`, its default initial route, a beat after
   * the push. `/panchanga` itself (this tab's index) is the one screen here
   * that is never a shell route, so this only bites a push that starts from
   * the daily page — confirmed the hard way, the button below the wheel
   * pushing to `/panchanga/year` reverted to the daily page every time.
   * `/kundali/$profileId` next door doesn't hit this: both it and `/kundali`
   * are already carved out via `routeUsesOwnPanchangaSplitShell`, which
   * incidentally keeps them on the same wrapper type too.
   *
   * Excluding this route from the shell list keeps it on the same `View`
   * branch as `/panchanga`, so nothing changes type mid-navigation. The
   * trade is losing the desktop sidebar rail on this one page; `year.tsx`'s
   * `AppShell` already renders its own `ScrollView` when it isn't hosted by
   * the shell, so nothing else here needed to change. */
