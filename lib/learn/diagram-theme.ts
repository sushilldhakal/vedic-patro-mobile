 * Colours for the 3D learn diagrams.

 * The canvas is always deep space — a dark scene reads far better on a phone
 * than a washed-out one, and it keeps the bodies legible in both app themes.
 * Only the panel around the canvas follows the theme; everything inside these
 * tables is fixed so a scene never comes out invisible in light mode.
