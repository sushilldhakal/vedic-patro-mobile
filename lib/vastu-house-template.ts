/**
 * The classical courtyard house, as a fixed template — no solver.
 *
 * A plain 3x3 of rooms is not what the treatises describe and not what a
 * Vastu plan looks like: the centre is an open court (Brahmasthāna), a
 * covered gallery (ālindra) rings it on all four sides so every room is
 * reached without crossing the court, and the rooms occupy the band outside
 * that gallery. Mayamata 26:15 for the galleries, Samarāṅgaṇa Sūtradhāra
 * 13:22 for the court staying open to the sky.
 *
 * Everything here is arithmetic on the plot's own dimensions. Rooms land in
 * the compass zone `assignVastuSpaces` already gave them and share that
 * zone's block in proportion to how much floor each kind wants. Nothing is
 * optimised, nothing can fail, and the same plot always draws the same plan.
