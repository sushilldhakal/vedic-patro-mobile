/**
 * One projected name over a playground canvas.
 *
 * Shared by both 3D studies, because the rule for how a belt name is drawn —
 * which colour, which glyph, how it is centred on an anchor it must not cover —
 * is the same in each and worth having in one place. The scenes differ in what
 * they *project*; they should not differ in how it looks.
 *
 * Memoised on the label's own fields, because a collecting pass replaces the
 * whole list and most entries have not changed since the last one.
 *
 * The glyph is drawn only for the division the body is actually standing in.
 * The web draws one beside every name, which it can afford — there the labels
 * are DOM nodes that never re-render. Here a pass is a React render of every
 * label, and twenty-seven नक्षत्र SVGs inside that is the difference between a
 * smooth transport row and a stuttering one. The undimmed one is the only glyph
 * carrying information anyway: it says where the Sun or the Moon is.
