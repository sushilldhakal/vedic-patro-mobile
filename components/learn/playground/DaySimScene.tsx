/**
 * "What is a day" — the R3F scene, on iOS and Android.
 *
 * A port of the web app's `components/learn/DaySimScene.tsx`. The geometry, the
 * frame, the mechanics and every constant are the same file's; what changed is
 * only the three things a phone cannot do the browser's way. They are marked
 * `── native ──` where they appear, and they are:
 *
 *   1. **Textures** come from the bundler through expo-asset, not from a URL
 *      under `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.
 *   2. **Labels** are collected a few times a second and drawn as React Native
 *      `Text` by the shell, instead of the scene writing `transform` on DOM
 *      nodes every frame. See `playground-labels.ts` for why.
 *   3. **राहु and केतु** are drawn, not rasterised. The web billboards the app's
 *      own SVG artwork through a canvas element; there is no canvas element
 *      here, so the two nodes are geometry — a ring for राहु's ascending
 *      crossing and a disc for केतु's descending one, in the same two colours,
 *      named by the label overlay.
 *
 * Everything below this line is the web scene's own commentary, kept because it
 * documents geometry that is genuinely identical:
 *
 * The frame is the planet's **equatorial** one: the XZ plane is the equator,
 * and the planet's spin axis is +Y and never moves. Axial tilt therefore does
 * not tilt the planet here — it tilts the *Sun's path*, which is the same
 * geometry read from the other end and the only arrangement in which the three
 * day-arcs can be drawn in one flat plane and compared. That is the whole
 * point of the picture, so it is worth the inversion.
 *
 * Origin is the **mean sun** — the fiction a clock keeps time by, moving at a
 * constant rate along the equator. The planet circles it at a fixed radius.
 * The **true sun** is placed separately from the real orbit (elliptical, and
 * tilted out of the equatorial plane), so the gap between the two suns is
 * visible directly: that gap is the equation of time.
 *
 * Three arcs wrap the planet, each measuring the same rotation against a
 * different zero:
 *
 *   - **sidereal** (blue, outermost) — against the fixed stars. Uniform.
 *   - **true solar** (gold, middle) — against the true sun. Never uniform.
 *   - **mean solar** (red, inner) — against the mean sun. Uniform by construction.
 *
 * The parent owns the clock and camera in refs and mutates them, so neither
 * playing nor dragging re-renders React. The scene reports a sampled snapshot
 * back through `onSample` a few times a second, and the overlay draws its
 * readouts from that.

          the planet turns under it, which is why a total eclipse sweeps a track
          across the ground rather than sitting on one country.

          invisible at any camera distance that also shows the Moon's orbit. The
          penumbra ring around it is the honest part of the shape: most of the
          places under it see a partial eclipse, not a total one.
