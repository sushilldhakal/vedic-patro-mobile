/**
 * One sky, two measures — the R3F scene, on iOS and Android.
 *
 * A port of the web app's `components/learn/TwoSystemsScene.tsx`. The geometry,
 * the ephemeris and every constant are that file's; the deviations are the same
 * two the day playground had to make, marked `── native ──`:
 *
 *   1. **Textures** come from the bundler through expo-asset rather than a URL.
 *   2. **Labels** are collected on the scene's own sample tick and drawn as
 *      React Native `Text` by the shell, instead of the scene writing DOM
 *      transforms. See `playground-labels.ts`.
 *
 * There is no third: this scene has no SVG artwork in it, so राहु and केतु's
 * problem does not arise here.
 *
 * Everything below is the web scene's own commentary, kept because it documents
 * geometry that is genuinely identical:
 *
 * Heliocentric on purpose. Earth goes round the Sun, the Moon goes round Earth,
 * and a sightline runs **from Earth through the Sun and on to the zodiac ring**
 * — which is what a rashi actually is: the direction the Sun is seen in from
 * here. Drawing it this way is the only way the scene can show the thing that
 * matters about a lunar month:
 *
 *   A month is not one lap of the Moon. While the Moon completes its 360°
 *   against the stars in 27.32 days, Earth has carried on ~27° around the Sun,
 *   so the Moon is no longer beside the Sun and is not yet at the next
 *   amavasya. It has to keep going — about **389°** in 29.53 days. Put Earth
 *   at a fixed origin and that extra 29° has nowhere to show; put Earth on its
 *   orbit and the Moon's own trail draws it.
 *
 * The frame is the app's: 0° मेष along +X, longitude increasing anticlockwise
 * seen from ecliptic north, the same as the 3D Aakash Gochar sky. Positions
 * come from `siderealLon`, which is that page's ephemeris with its
 * double-counted precession corrected.
 *
 * The parent owns the clock and the camera in refs, so neither animating nor
 * dragging re-renders React — the scene reports a sampled snapshot back through
 * `onSample` a few times a second, and that is what the HUD reads.
