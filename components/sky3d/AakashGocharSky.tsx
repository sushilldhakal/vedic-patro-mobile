             *
             * 1. The fisheye is normalised against the *shorter* screen axis,
             *    which on a portrait phone is the width. Dividing by the
             *    height made every drag about `height/width` (~2.2×) too
             *    small — the "pulling the sky through rubber" feel.
             * 2. `fov` is linear in θ, but the projection is stereographic,
             *    `r = 2·tan(θ/2)`. The two agree at narrow fields and diverge
             *    badly wide open: at 235° the linear figure is 1.6× short.
             * 3. Screen-horizontal motion is a turn about the camera's own up
             *    axis, and yaw is about the *world's*. The two differ by
             *    cos(pitch), so looking near the zenith a horizontal drag
             *    needed several times the yaw it was given — which is exactly
             *    the "barely moves near the top" complaint.
             *
             * So: invert the projection at the finger's own position to get
             * the angle a pixel is worth *there* (stereographic is conformal,
             * so one isotropic factor covers both axes), and divide the yaw by
             * cos(pitch). Incremental, one move event at a time, because the
             * scale is position-dependent and a from-the-start delta would be
             * measured at the wrong place.
             *
             * Both signs are "the sky follows the finger" — pull down and the
             * sky comes down with you. `pitch` counts *downward* from the
