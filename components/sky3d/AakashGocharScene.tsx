/**
 * The 3D scene for Aakash Gochar — everything inside the <Canvas>.
 *
 * Two views of the same sky, both geocentric:
 *
 * • `space` — the solar system seen from outside, Earth at the centre. Grahas
 *   ride shells in the classical Moon-to-Saturn order at their true sidereal
 *   longitude and shara, so vakri loops and the belt geometry read directly.
 * • `horizon` — the sky standing over one place at one instant. Longitudes are
 *   carried through the equatorial frame into alt/az, so the rashi belt tips by
 *   the observer's latitude and swings with the hour, exactly as it does
 *   overhead. This is the view where the ecliptic is emphatically *not* flat.
 *
 * Per-frame work is deliberately imperative: positions are written straight
 * onto object refs and React only hears from the scene a few times a second,
 * via `onSample`.
