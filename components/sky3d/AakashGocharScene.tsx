/**
 * The 3D scene for Aakash Gochar — everything inside the <Canvas>.
 *
 * Two views of the same sky, both geocentric:
 *
 * • `space` — the solar system seen from outside, Earth at the centre. Grahas
 *   ride shells in the classical Moon-to-Saturn order at their true sidereal
 *   longitude and shara, so vakri loops and the belt geometry read directly.
 * • `horizon` — the sky standing over one place at one instant. Longitudes are
 *   carried through the equatorial frame into alt/az, so the rashi belt tips by
 *   the observer's latitude and swings with the hour, exactly as it does
 *   overhead. This is the view where the ecliptic is emphatically *not* flat.
 *
 * Per-frame work is deliberately imperative: positions are written straight
 * onto object refs. Overlay names follow the same projection as the star
 * points, so they do not lag behind a turning sky. The HUD clock still samples
 * a few times a second via `onSample`.

/* Young (1994)'s fit, geometric altitude — {@link Extinction::airmass}'s
   own "apparent_z = false" branch, which is the one MilkyWay.cpp calls.
   Stellarium never evaluates this below the horizon at all — its ground
   blocks the view, so the branch below never mattered there. This dome
   has no such floor at a wide enough field (a fisheye past ~180° shows
   sky *and* what would be underground in every direction at once).

   The fit itself is a rational polynomial only well-behaved for the
   *above*-horizon domain it was built for: fed a large negative cosZ
   (deep "underground") the denominator changes sign and the whole
   fraction goes negative, which as an exponent on 0.3 *brightens* the
   pixel past its own original colour — worse than doing nothing.
   Clamping that blow-up to a single large fixed airmass instead (an
   earlier version of this fix) swung the other way: the real curve is
   already near-total extinction within a couple of degrees of the
   horizon on either side, so *any* "big number" clamp reads as flat
   black the instant the horizon is crossed, and the band simply stopped
   existing below it.

   Mirroring the input around the horizon — abs(cosZ) — sidesteps both
   failure modes at once instead of patching either one: it never leaves
   the polynomial's own well-behaved domain (abs keeps the argument in
   the same [0, 1] range zenith-to-horizon already uses without
   incident), so ten degrees under the horizon gets exactly the
   extinction ten degrees above it already had — a real, continuously
   fading band on both sides of the line, not a cliff to full brightness
   or a cliff to black. */

       the sky at two very different radii and a fixed world size would
       read as the right size in one and wildly wrong in the other.

       Each is drawn only across the band of zoom where it reads as a
       patch of sky rather than as wallpaper — see {@link nebulaReveal} —
       and its texture is not even fetched until it first earns one.

       Additive, and in the galactic plane a few of these genuinely
       overlap — Barnard's Loop's own four tiles, the Lambda Orionis ring
       over the same stars, Heart and Soul side by side in Cassiopeia —
       so a strength that looks right for one image sums brighter where
       two or three stack, and the Milky Way panorama sitting under all of
       them is itself additive. 0.4 is chosen against that pile-up: high
       enough that a single photograph — the ordinary case, and the whole
       point of searching one up — reads as a photograph and not a
       barely-there haze, low enough that two or three genuinely
       overlapping fields still separate instead of clipping to flat
       white or pink.

       `reveal` is a function of the zoom the reader is *at right now*
       (`view.current.distance`), which changes on every scroll and not at
       all on the clock. Gated behind the belt's own throttle, a paused
       क्षितिज never recomputed it — zooming in on a photograph left it at
       whatever opacity, scale and reveal it had the moment the clock last
       ticked, which for a still sky is never again, and the same held for

            every skybox actually wants — drawn first, behind everything,
            never fighting the depth buffer at all. The ecliptic disc's own
            transparency is what keeps stars off the belt, not draw order
            against this any more.

            placeholder any more.

            `transparent` is for the fade only — depth is still off above, so

            2048×1024 over the whole sphere: fine at the field it was framed

            into a soft blur once a press has pulled in on one star or
            planet. Rather than ship a sharper file, the fade below just
            takes it out of the picture before it gets that close — the same
            call a real dark-sky photo would make, since the eye stops
            reading it as the Milky Way and starts reading it as one smudged
            star's neighbourhood at that magnification anyway.

            Additive, the same as their own `glBlendFunc(GL_ONE, GL_ONE)` —
            it lets the star points sitting in front of it glow *through* the

            layer would, and it is why theirs never reads as a brighter
